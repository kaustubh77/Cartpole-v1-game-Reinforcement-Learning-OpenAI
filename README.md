# OpenAI Gym CartPole-v1 Neural Network (Reinforcement Learning)

  The game CartPole-v1 is considered solved when the average score attained by the bot is >= 195.0 over 100 consecutive trials, which this model does.
 
I was able to get an average score of 460 per game when played for 100 games. The model consists of 11 layers. The action space contains 2 variables while the observation space has 4 variables in case of the Cartpole game.
